#Team 9103 Robot Code

##Environment Setup

You'll need to setup a development environment to do work here.

###Requirements

1. A computer to do work on. OS does not matter. I personally use Qubes OS, but you'd be better off using Windows.
..* A laptop is recommended, as you'll be able to do easy troubleshooting and fixing of the robot.
2. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
3. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
..* For Linux, go [here](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop/releases)
4. (Optional) Git
..* Windows: [Click Me!](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
..* Linux: Install via your package manager (package name will be git)
